1. *Write a python script that ask for two numbers, add them together and output the response into a file called 'maths.txt'*
2. *Write a python script that keeps asking for names, until they enter an empty name, then creates a file called 'people.txt' and adds names on a separate line*
3. *Write a python script that reads a file called 'names.txt' (which has names separated by a new line), then converts each name to the correct casing and outputs them to a file called 'names-formated.txt' Eg:* 
```
lAchlan velDen -> Lachlan Velden
Frank joe -> Frank Joe

4. *Write a python script that outputs the factorial of all numbers from 1 - 10. eg:*
```
# output is after '->'
1 -> 1
2 = 1x2 -> 2
3 = 1x2x3 -> 6
4 = 1x2x3x4 -> 24
```
5. *Write a python script that asks for a username and password, then opens 'logins.txt' and tries to find a valid ':' separated login from this file. eg:*
```
file:
